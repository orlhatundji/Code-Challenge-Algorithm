#Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.

# Complete the 'diagonalDifference' function below. It must return an integer representing the absolute diagonal difference.
#
# The function is expected to return an INTEGER.
# The function accepts 2D_INTEGER_ARRAY arr as parameter.
#For example, the square matrix arr is shown below:
# 1 2 3
# 4 5 6
# 9 8 9 
# The left-to-right diagonal = 1+5+9. The right to left diagonal = 3+5+9. Their absolute difference is |15-17|=2.

def diagonalDifference(arr):
    leftdiagonalsum = 0
    rightdiagonalsum = 0
    index = 0
    for i in range(n):
        rightdiagonalsum += arr[i][index]
        leftdiagonalsum += arr[i][n-index-1]
        index += 1
    return(abs(rightdiagonalsum-leftdiagonalsum))
